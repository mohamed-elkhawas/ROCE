\section{Purpose of the controller}

\hspace{10mm}A passive component designed to resist changes in current. Inductors are often referred to as “AC resistors”. The ability
to resist changes in current and store energy in its magnetic field account for the bulk of the useful properties of inductors. Current passing through an inductor will produce a magnetic field. A changing magnetic field induces a voltage which opposes the field-producing current. This property of impeding changes of current is known as inductance. The voltage induced across an inductor by a change of current is defined as:
$$V = L \frac{di}{dt}$$



\section{Features}


%\hspace{10mm}The DDR3 controller supports the following features: \begin{abstract}
 %   Supports JEDEC standard JESD79-3C – DDR3 compliant devices
%\end{abstract}


\begin{itemize}
    \item 33-bit address for 8 GB of address space.
    \item 16/32/64-bit data bus width support.
    \item CAS latencies: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.
    \item 1, 2, 4, and 8 internal banks.
    \item Burst Length: 8.
    \item Burst Type: sequential.
    \item 8GB address space available over one or two chip selects.
    \item Page sizes: 256, 512, 1024, and 2048-word.
    \item SDRAM auto initialization from reset or configuration change.
    \item Self-refresh mode.
    \item Prioritized refresh scheduling.
    \item Programmable SDRAM refresh rate and backlog counter.
    \item Programmable SDRAM timing parameters.
    \item Big and little endian modes.
    \item ECC on SDRAM data bus.
    \item 8-bit ECC per 64-bit data quanta without additional cycle latency.
    \item Two latency classes supported.
    \item UDIMM Address mirroring is not supported.
\end{itemize}
 

\section{The DDR5 technology}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Every command between the controller and the request must be in bursts (16 (columns or normal requests)).
    \item There is small timing constrains between the commands in different bank groups.
    \item The timing constrains between the two commands in the same bank is the largest then the two banks in the same bank group then the different bank groups.
    \item There is timing constrains between writing to the memory and reading from it.
\end{enumerate}

%\hspace{10mm}For mathematical expressions of Inductance and Capacitance refer eq. \ref{eq1} and eq. \ref{eq2}


desicion:
The main diff is that thread fair algo has higher priority to read requests while RLDP always 
focus on row hits,thus, it has too much transitions between reads and writes, so it leaves out 
the read queue and stall the system 


1- The algo continues to write always if there is a row hit
2- if there is a row hit, then we switch to read queue.
3- Its the problem that we leave read queue if there is a row hit on write queue, so we
decided to insert a new condition to delay this switching in future cycles and priotirzes the read queue higher than write drain.


we can switch to thread-fair algo later. we can jsut edit our flowchart in the lower branches 
and turn it into thread-fair!






\section{The memory controller structure:}
%\begin{itemize}
 %   \item Front-end structure
  %  \begin{itemize}
   %     \item Transaction controller
    %        \begin{itemize}
     %           \item Mapper       
      %          \item Returner
       %         \item Over flow stopper
        %        \item Request saver
         %   \end{itemize} 
        
        
        %\item Modified FIFO (per bank)
        %\item Bank scheduler (per bank)
        

    %\end{itemize}        
    %\item Back-end structure
     %   \begin{itemize}
      %      \item Arbiter       
       %     \item Timing controller
        %    \item Burst handler
        %\end{itemize}
%\end{itemize}






\subsection{Mapper block:}
 Applies mapping scheme and gives every request special index
\subsection{Returner block:} 
 Waits for specific request index to return then it send it out of the controller if other requests come it saves it in it until its turn to be sent out comes
\subsection{Over flow stopper block: }  
 Make shore that there are no two requests in the controller have the same index
\subsection{Request saver block:} 
 Stores the request that came out from the mapper when the Modified FIFO block is full then send it as soon as there is place at the FIFO
\subsection{Modified FIFO block:}
 It has two FIFO buffers inside one for the write request data (has low entries number) and another for the request type,
 address and index (with high entries number). It saves and assign the data if it’s write request only
































\section{Refresh Management}
\hspace{10mm}A Buck converter takes the voltage from a DC source and converts the voltage of supply into lower DC voltage level. Some devices need a certain amount of voltage to run the device. Too much of power can destroy the device or less power may not be able to run the device.This output voltage is achieved by chopping the input voltage with a series of connected switches that apply pulses to an averaging inductor and capacitor circuit.
