\section{Purpose of the controller}

\hspace{10mm}A passive component designed to resist changes in current. Inductors are often referred to as “AC resistors”. The ability
to resist changes in current and store energy in its magnetic field account for the bulk of the useful properties of inductors. Current passing through an inductor will produce a magnetic field. A changing magnetic field induces a voltage which opposes the field-producing current. This property of impeding changes of current is known as inductance. The voltage induced across an inductor by a change of current is defined as:
$$V = L \frac{di}{dt}$$
